# Lab Name
_Pluggable Hedera Consensus Service_

# Short Description
_The Pluggable HCS Lab proves the ability of a Hyperledger Fabric network to connect to the Hedera Consensus Serivce running on a publicly accessilbe testnetwork._

# Scope of Lab
_This lab is designed to enable a pluggable consensus option within Hyperledger Fabric. The Hedera Consensus Service is available on the Hedera public network. The Lab initially uses the Build Your First Network (BYFN) Hyperledger Fabric sample to connect a set of Orderers to the Hedera Consensus Service. The demo proves the ability of HCS to deliver a set of ordered transactions from the public network to a Fabric network for block creation and propogation._
