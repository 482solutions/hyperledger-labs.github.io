# Lab Name
_byzantine-api-gateway_

# Short Description
_Enables client access to Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network through restful API's._

# Scope of Lab
_Currently client applications can access HLF network Peers using the GoLang, Node, or Java SDK's. This project provides a generalized API gateway that will allow users to query, execute transactions along with querying block storage and configuration using restul API's.

This project provides a ready to use solution that developers would otherwise have to implement when trying to provide web clients access to a HLF network._
